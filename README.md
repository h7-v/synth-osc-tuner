# STM32 Synth Oscillator Tuner with Two Inputs

![Tuner used inside Dual Oscillator Eurorack module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h7-v/synth-osc-tuner/main/images/mb_display.PNG)

I originally designed this to be used with a replica Macbeth Dual Oscillator I built, but it will work with any audio oscillator as long as the voltage range sits between 0V and 5V.

This project uses the STM32F411 but any chip with at least two 32-bit timers will work.
